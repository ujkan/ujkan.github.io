Hi there, I'm Ujkan! I'm a software developer living in Munich.

I'm a full stack + operations developer (a *DevOps Engineer*, if you like) working in [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/de/de)'s Munich
 office. In my current project, I work on developing an SPA with Angular and Spring Boot. 
 I'm also involved in maintaining and extending the application's infrastructure 
 with AWS CDK, as well as writing GitHub Workflows for our CI/CD pipelines.

Besides that, I have experience in a few other programming languages,
most substantially in Python, Haskell, and C.

I'm currently interested in:
- automation with quick&dirty scripts (even when it costs more time)
- [writing](https://ujkan.github.io/year-archive/)
- information architecture patterns (in the style of Christoph Alexander's 
*A Pattern Language*) as tools for organizing and improving thinking and
cognition
- software development principles that go beyond the 
- finding the Goldilocks zone of abstraction in programming
dogmatic popular philosophies (such as *Clean Code*)
