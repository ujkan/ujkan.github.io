Hi there, I'm Ujkan!

I work as a Consultant at CGI. I'm active as a Full Stack Developer (Spring + Angular) in my current project.

## Some more about me
My latest preoccupation varies month to month, either due to a revived or newfangled passion. I've thus dabbled in: Haskell, OCaml, C, Python, Lua, Isabelle/HOL. Don't be surprised to catch me revisiting monads one blog post and writing a small linear algebra library in FORTRAN the next (I really should do this some time).

I wanted to study Mathematics, but was persuaded against it, so I ended up getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at TU Munich. During that time, I explored a bunch of different areas and settled in the wildlands of Interactive Theorem Proving (with Isabelle/HOL). For my senior project, I formally [verified](https://lmcs.episciences.org/9148) a 2-approximation algorithm; and for my thesis I formally [verified](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Hales_Jewett.html) a proof of the Hales-Jewett Theorem. Of course, my love for Mathematics never waned: I took (among others) two classes that brought me a lot of joy as part of my Minor in Maths. These were Abstract Algebra and Geometry, the latter a wonderful mix of Projective, Combinatorial, and Differential Geometry. 

Outside of work, I spend my time learning new things (currently ML through CS229 @ Stanford), playing sports, and cooking.
