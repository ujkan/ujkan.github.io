Hi there, I'm Ujkan!

I'm a Full Stack Developer working at [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/de/de)'s Munich
 office. In my current project, I work on
 developing an SPA with Angular and Spring. Recently, I've been given
 responsibilties for parts of the project's infrastructure, which is hosted on
 AWS. On that end, I maintain and extend infrastructure with AWS CDK and write
GitHub Workflows for the CI/CD Pipeline.

Besides that, I have experience in a smattering of other programming languages,
among them Python, C, and Haskell. 

I'm currently interested in the following topics:
- best practices in state management with NgRx
- information architecture patterns (in the style of Christoph Alexander's 
*A Pattern Language*) for optimal UX
- solid software engineering methodologies that extend beyond the clich√©d and 
dogmatic popular philosophies (such as *Clean Code*)
