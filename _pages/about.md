Hi there, I'm Ujkan! I'm a software developer. I live in Munich.

I am a full stack + operations dev working at [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/de/de)'s Munich
 office. In my current project, I work on an SPA with Angular and Spring. 
 I also work on the project's cloud infrastructure, which is hosted on
 AWS. On that end, I maintain and extend the infra with AWS CDK and write
GitHub Workflows for our CI/CD pipelines.

Besides that, I have experience in a few other programming languages,
among them Python, C, and Haskell.

I'm currently interested in (at varying levels):
- automation with quick&dirty scripts even when it costs more time
- [writing](https://ujkan.github.io/year-archive/)
- information architecture patterns (in the style of Christoph Alexander's 
*A Pattern Language*) as a tool for thought
- software development principles that go beyond the 
dogmatic popular philosophies (such as *Clean Code*)
  - see [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/),
