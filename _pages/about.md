Hi!

I'm currently in the role of Consultant for CGI, primarily working as a Java Backend Developer.

I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at TU Munich in November 2022. During that time, I acquired skills in imperative (Java, C, Python) and functional (Haskell, OCaml) programming languages. Additionally, I have experience in formal verification with Isabelle/HOL. For example, I formally verified a 2-approximation algorithm and the Hales-Jewett Theorem.

Outside of work, I spend my time learning new things (currently ML through CS229 @ Stanford), playing sports, and cooking.
