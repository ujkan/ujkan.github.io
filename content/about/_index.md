Currently, I'm a full stack + operations developer (a *DevOps Engineer*, if you like) working in [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/de/de)'s Munich
 office.

My driving forces:
- become an expert in (complex) systems-thinking
- master the *art* of programming (which is a tool for engineering systems)
- write along the journey
- enjoy the beauty of CS

During my university days, I was obsessed with *theory*, especially the fundamentals of CS: theory of computation (formal languages, automata, Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus) and theory of programming languages (semantics, types).

Yet I spent little time building things. To compensate for this tragic oversight, I've made the conscious decision to not spend a second learning any theory without writing code at the same time.

In the next five years I want to implement, on a small scale, a little bit of everything. Among other things, the following:
- a compiler
- parts of `libc`
- common data structures & algorithms in several languages (at least: C, Haskell, C++)
- an ISA simulator
- a graphics engine
- parts of an OS
- a web server
- parts of the TCP/IP stack

Will I succeed? No. Is it worth trying? Yes.

Right now, I'm actively interested in:
- automation with quick&dirty scripts (even when it costs more time)
- [writing](/year-archive/)
- information architecture patterns (in the style of Christoph Alexander's
*A Pattern Language*) as tools for organizing and improving thinking and
cognition
- software development principles that go beyond the
dogmatic popular philosophies (such as *Clean Code*)
