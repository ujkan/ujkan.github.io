Hi there, I'm Ujkan! I'm a software developer living in Munich. This website
serves primarily as an archive of my writings and an exercise in static web
design. More about me [here](/about).

Besides that, I have experience in a few other programming languages,
most substantially in Python, Haskell, and C.

I'm currently interested in:
- automation with quick&dirty scripts (even when it costs more time)
- [writing](/year-archive/)
- information architecture patterns (in the style of Christoph Alexander's 
*A Pattern Language*) as tools for organizing and improving thinking and
cognition
- software development principles that go beyond the 
dogmatic popular philosophies (such as *Clean Code*), see:
  - [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)
  - [Core Design Principles for Software Developers by Venkat Subramaniam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGgO74uXMI)
  - [A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201)
- finding the Goldilocks zone of abstraction in programming
